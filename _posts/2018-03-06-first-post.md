Wow, my first post. Finally got a blog going again. Maybe I can find my old blog (from blogger?) and export my posts over to here.

Things I plan to talk about on this site:
1. programming stuff; typically ruby, rails, and web stuff in general
2. topics related to Samvera's Sufia/Hyrax stack
3. Mayb's some personal stuff
